## UI Design Note
Currently, the patient data table lists all visits directly, which may result in duplicate rows for the same patient when they have multiple visits. This was a conscious decision made due to time constraints to prioritize delivering a working application.

Alternative UX approaches we could implement:

1. Accordion rows: Each row expands to reveal a nested table or details for visits.

2. "View Visits" Action Button: An action column with a button/icon that opens a popup/modal to display that patient's complete visit history.
